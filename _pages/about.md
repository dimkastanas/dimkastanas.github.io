I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Napoleon Katsos

My research interests focus on natural language meaning in neurotypical and neurodiverse populations, with an emphasis on both semantics and pragmatics. I explore the processes that enable interlocutors to coordinate in real-time language communication and how these processes are implemented in the brain. My research primarily involves English, Greek, and Chinese (Mandarin) utilizing behavioral and neuroscientific methods to investigate these questions. To learn more about my research, feel free to explore further or check out my publications.

I firmly believe that collaboration leads to the best outcomes. Below are a few of my own mentors and collaborators so far:

- Napoleon Katsos (Cambridge)
- Robert Hawkins (Winsconsin)
- Alexandre Cremers (Vilnius)
- Guanyi Chen (Wuhan)
- Kees van Deeemter (Utrecht)
- Suyun Xu (Shanghai)
- Songqiao Xie (Cambridge)
- Jessica Fleck (Cambridge)
- Yizhuo Zhang (Cambridge)
