I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Napoleon Katsos.

My research interests focus on natural language meaning in neurotypical and neurodiverse populations, with an emphasis on both semantics and pragmatics. I explore the processes that enable interlocutors to coordinate in real-time language communication and how these processes are implemented in the brain. My research primarily involves English, Greek, and Chinese (Mandarin) utilizing behavioral and neuroscientific methods to investigate these questions. I am also passionate about the use of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to better understand the underlying processes of social reasoning—especially pragmatic reasoning—when these processes go awry, as well as the necessary steps for targeted interventions through novel LLM applications.
