I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Napoleon Katsos

My research interests focus on natural language meaning in neurotypical and neurodiverse populations, with an emphasis on both semantics and pragmatics. I explore the processes that enable interlocutors to coordinate in real-time language communication and how these processes are implemented in the brain. My research primarily involves English and Greek, utilizing behavioral and neuroscientific methods to investigate these questions. To learn more about my research, feel free to explore further or check out my publications.
