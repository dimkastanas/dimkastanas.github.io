I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge.

My research interests currently lie in the area of natural language meaning in neurotypical and neurodiverse populations, including both semantics and pragmatics: what are the processes that make interlocutors coordinate in real time language communication and how are these processes implemented within the brain? I primarily conduct research on English and Green and I use behavioural and neuroscientific methods for pursuing these questions. Find out more about my research or check out my publications.
