I conduct research on natural language meaning: currently, I focus on ad hoc implicatures, perspective-taking and informativeness. Specifically, I investigate the way these processes intersect during language communication using simple and fun referential games. To answer my research questions, I make use of methods and models from theoretical linguistics, computational psycholinguistics and neuroscience.

# Methods

I collect data through a variety of methods:

- production and comprehension experiments, in the laboratory or via the internet
- psychological techniques (eye-tracking)
- neuroscientific techniques (EEG)
- computational cognitive modelling

# Languages

To understand cross-linguistic variation and how different processes unfold in language communication, it is vital to study languages beyond English. For this reason, I am also interested in comparing how these processes occur during laanguage communication in Greek and Chienese neurotypical and neurodiverse (mainly autistic) populations.

# Current Research Areas

## Ad Hoc Implicatures

When a speaker says, "Give me the bag with apples" and there are two bags -one with apples and another one with apples and oranges- you understand that they want the bag with only apples. This interpretation is derived from an ad hoc implicature using visual context. However, if the same expression is used and there is only a bag with apples and oranges, you underatand that they want this bag. Arriving at the correct interpetation each time requires pragmatic reasoning. In my research, I investigate the processes behind this type of pragmatic reasoning in both English and Chinese neurotypical and autistic listeners. Furthermore, I investigate what kinds of expressions naive speakers would produce in similar communicative situations.

## Visual Perspective Taking

In a classroom, a teacher stands in front of a map with a mountain on the left and a river on the right from their perspective. The students, facing the teacher, see the mountain on their right. When the teacher asks, "Can you point to the mountain?" a student who understands the teacher's perspective will point to the left side of the map, even though it appears on their right. This process is called Visual Perspective Taking. In my research, I investigate how Visual Perspective Taking influences speakers' expressions in tasks requiring pragmatic processing and the corresponding effects on listeners' comprehension. We create novel tasks, building on previous research, to explore the effects of visual asymmetries between neurotypical and autistic speakers and listeners on pragmatic reasoning.

## Informativeness

Many studies on referential communication have shown that speakers tend to be over-specific in their instructions; that is, they provide more information than necessary for the listener to identify the referential object. Here, we captilaise on this finding to investigate the effects of over-specificity on pragmatic reasoning.
