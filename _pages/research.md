I conduct research on natural language meaning: currently, I focus on ad hoc implicatures, perspective-taking and informativeness. Specifically, I investigate the way these processes intersect during language communication using simple and fun referential games. To answer my research questions, I make use of methods and models from theoretical linguistics, computational psycholinguistics and neuroscience.

# Methods

I collect data through a variety of methods:

- production and comprehension experiments, in the laboratory or via the internet
- psychological techniques (eye-tracking)
- neuroscientific techniques (EEG)
- computational cognitive modelling

# Languages

To understand cross-linguistic variation and how different processes unfold in language communication, it is vital to study languages beyond English. For this reason, I am also interested in comparing how these processes occur during laanguage communication in Greek and Chinese neurotypical and neurodiverse (mainly autistic) populations.
