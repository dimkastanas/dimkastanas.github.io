I conduct research on natural language meaning: currently, I focus on ad hoc implicatures, perspective-taking and informativeness. Specifically, I investigate the way these processes intersect during language communication using simple and fun referential games. To answer my research questions, I make use of methods and models from theoretical linguistics, computational psycholinguistics and neuroscience.

# Methods

I collect data through a variety of methods:

- production and comprehension experiments, in the laboratory or via the internet
- psychological techniques (eye-tracking)
- neuroscientific techniques (EEG)

# Languages

To understand cross-linguistic variation and the way different processes unfold in language communication, it is vital to study other languages beyond English. For this reason, my interest is also on the comparison of the ways these processes play out during lkanguage communication in Green and Chienese neurotypical and neurodiverse populations.
