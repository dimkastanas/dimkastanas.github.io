# Research

I conduct research on natural language meaning: currently, I focus on projective content, social meaning (irony, dog whistles), and discourse structure. To investigate how meaning arises from the complex expressions that speakers utter and how listeners understand what speakers intend to communicate, I make use of methods and models from theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and computational linguistics.
